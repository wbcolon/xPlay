TODO:

- if queue is played and then songs are added then the last song is autoplayed. It should start with the newly added (phonon, verify for qt)
- if playlist is at the end then the player does not go into the stop state (phonon, verify for qt)
- player sometimes seems to halt "source ignored..." -> maybe internal issue. -> try to recover.
- player at last queue song (still playing). Songs added to the queue are not played after last song finished.
